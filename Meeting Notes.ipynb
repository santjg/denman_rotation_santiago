I additionally completed (after plenty of trial and error) the Python for Neuroscience Intro and Receptive Fields notebooks. To give me a better background in the lab’s research and experimental design, I spent time reading some papers from the Lab Canon and watched the first two lectures from the Harvard CS50 course\n",
