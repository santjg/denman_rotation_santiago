    "This week was mainly devoted to familiarizing myself with the lab. I went through the learnpython.org tutorial to familiarize myself with the basics of python. I additionally completed (after plenty of trial and error) the Python for Neuroscience Intro and Receptive Fields notebooks. To give me a better background in the lab’s research and experimental design, I spent time reading some papers from the Lab Canon and watched the first two lectures from the Harvard CS50 course\n",

This is a very new field for me and I would love both feedback and guidance regarding how I’m approaching problems and what the realities of the science are. Any additional references you might suggest could also be helpful. Apart from that, I think you’ve been very available and patient responding to my questions, so just keep that up if you can!\n",

C8 was found to have a loose, infected head cap on 06/29 and was sacrificed. Dan showed me how to use OpenEphys and set up the neuropixels for saline recordings.
